Ensure you have the necessary privileges to execute the script (root/sudo access is required).

Running the Script

Download or copy the script to your system.

Make it executable by running:

chmod +x script.sh

Execute the script with:

./script.sh

Automating Execution

You can set up a cron job to run this script automatically at a specified interval. For example, to run it every Sunday at midnight, add the following line to your crontab:

Creating an Alias

To create an alias for the script, so you can run it with a simple command, follow these steps:

Open your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):

nano ~/.bashrc

Add the following line at the end of the file:

alias update-system='/path/to/script.sh'

Save the file and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

Apply the changes by running:

Now, you can run the script using:
